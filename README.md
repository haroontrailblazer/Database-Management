## üöÄ Overview
Welcome to the **Database Management** repository! This project is all about mastering the art of database management using two powerful tools: **SQL** and **MongoDB**. Whether you are a beginner or looking to refine your skills, this repository offers valuable resources and examples to guide you through the concepts and practical applications.

## üõ† Technologies Used
- **SQL**: The standard language for relational database management, enabling you to query and manipulate data with ease.
- **MongoDB**: A leading NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, ideal for handling unstructured data.

## üìÇ Contents
- `sql/`: Contains SQL scripts and examples.
- `mongodb/`: Contains MongoDB scripts and examples.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## üìö What You‚Äôll Learn
1. **SQL Basics**: Data retrieval, manipulation, and management.
2. **Advanced SQL Queries**: Complex joins, subqueries, and transactions.
3. **MongoDB Basics**: Document-oriented data storage and CRUD operations.
4. **Advanced MongoDB**: Aggregation, indexing, and performance optimization.
5. **Practical Projects**: Hands-on projects to apply your database management skills.

## üîß Getting Started

# SQL Keyword Case Sensitivity

## Overview

In different SQL query language implementations, there might be variations in how they handle case sensitivity for keywords. For example, in MySQL Workbench or shell, keywords such as `DESCRIBE`, `USE`, `CREATE`, `ALTER`, etc., are accepted in both capital and small letters. However, in some SQL shells, these keywords are only accepted when written in capital letters.

## Examples
SQL Shell (Case Sensitive)
These queries must be written in capital letters to be accepted

DESCRIBE table_name;
USE database_name;
CREATE TABLE example (id INT);

Conclusion:
When working with different SQL shells,
be mindful of their case sensitivity rules
for SQL keywords to avoid syntax errors.

### MySQL Workbench/Shell
```sql
-- Both of these queries are valid in MySQL Workbench/Shell

DESCRIBE table_name;
describe table_name;

USE database_name;
use database_name;

CREATE TABLE example (id INT);
create table example (id int);
